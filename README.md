# MCAuth

Authentication has gotten very boring. Nobody wants to enter a password, then a TOTP code, or even plug in a Yubikey. Behold, MCAuth, the one-of-a-kind easy-to-use Minecraft-based authentication system. You can embed this in any type of project, whether it be a website, app, or desktop program!
